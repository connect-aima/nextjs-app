Cookies are small pieces of data that a server sends to a user’s browser, and the browser automatically stores them and sends them back to the same server with every future request. This allows the server to maintain state in the otherwise stateless HTTP protocol. Cookies are commonly used for session management (like keeping users logged in), personalization (storing preferences such as theme or language), and tracking or analytics (recording user behavior). Each cookie includes attributes like expiration time, security flags (secure, httpOnly), path rules, and sameSite protections), all of which define how the cookie behaves and how secure it is. Cookies can be session-based or persistent and are always transmitted through HTTP headers (Set-Cookie and Cookie). In Next.js route handlers, cookies can be read or set using built‑in APIs, allowing the backend to authenticate users, store preferences, and maintain user-specific data. Understanding cookies is essential because they form the foundation of login systems, session handling, personalization features, and many other backend operations in modern web applications.
